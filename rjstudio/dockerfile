# Step 1: Build the React app
# FROM node:20-alpine

# Set the working directory inside the container
# WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if available)
# COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
# RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the app's source code
# COPY . .

# Expose the port on which Nginx will run
# EXPOSE 3000

# CMD [ "npm", "start"]

#--------------------------------------------------------------
    # Stage 1: Build the app
FROM node:20-alpine as builder

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install --only=production

# Copy the entire source code into the container
COPY . .

# Optional: Build the code if you're using a build step (TypeScript, Webpack)
# RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Create the final image with only the necessary files
FROM node:18-slim

# Set working directory in the final image
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the built output from the builder stage (production files only)
COPY --from=builder /app /app

# Expose the application port (if needed)
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
